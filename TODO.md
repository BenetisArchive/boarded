- Add datepicker from ng-bootstrap once it gets published
- User -> two types - with auth and without
- Login component should be in separate module
- Email validation (sending?)
- Validation should move to reactive forms also for more consistency


- Auth
  - Check not only if local storage has token but also if token is valid for routing
  - Consume errors from console log
